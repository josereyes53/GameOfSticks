 *
 * The following is an implementation
 * of the Game of Sticks in C++
 *
 * We'll be defining a void function (gameOfSticks)
 * for convenience.
 *
 * In gameOfSticks we'll define three integer variables:
 *     sticksOnTable; initialized at 1 because, in addition
 *         to it storing the inital numbers of sticks on the table,
 *         it will serve as the condition for the do while loop for
 *         the game itself
 *     playerOneSticks; where player one's choice each turn will be stored
 *     playerTwoSticks; where player two's choice each turn will be stored
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *
 * Output welcome message
 * Input initial number of sticks on table
 * Check that the number meets the condition (10-100)
 *
 * REPEAT
 *     Input player one's choice
 *     Check that the choice meets the condition (1-3)
 *
 *     Update the number of sticks on table
 *
 *     If the number of sticks left is zero or less
 *         player one loses
 *
 *     Input player two's choice
 *     Check that the choice meets the condition (1-3)
 *
 *     Update the number of sticks on table
 *
 *     If the number of sticks left is zero or less
 *         player two loses loses
 * UNTIL no more sticks on table
 *
 * For Human vs AI, we will randomly choose a number for
 * the AI based upon the number of sticks on the table.
 * A vector of vectors will be populated by the possible
 * choices every step of the game, and every winning step
 * by the AI will be added to the vector and as such, there
 * will be a higher probablity of the AI choosing winning moves.
 *
 * For AI vs AI, the same will occur, but between two vectors.
 * Afterwards, the human player shall play agasint the winning AI.
